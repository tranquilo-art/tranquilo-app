// Shared Sentry init for /api serverless functions -- Vercel Hobby's own
// runtime logs retain only 1 hour, so an error at 2am is otherwise
// invisible by morning. Lives outside /api/ for the usual function-cap
// reason. No Sentry SDK variant targets Vercel's bare (req, res) style, so
// each /api file wraps its own try/catch with reportError() instead.
// reportError() always awaits Sentry.flush(), since a Vercel function can
// freeze the instant its response is sent, dropping an unflushed event.
// Sentry.init() with no dsn no-ops rather than throwing, so this is safe to
// import before SENTRY_DSN is set, same fail-quiet posture as getSql().

// headers/any `user` object before an event leaves the process.
